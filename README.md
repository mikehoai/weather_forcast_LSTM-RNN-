It leverages a weather dataset sourced from Kaggle to predict future weather conditions.  This README provides a comprehensive guide to setting up, running, and understanding the project.

## üåü Project Overview

Accurate weather prediction is crucial for various applications, from daily planning to agriculture and disaster preparedness.  This project uses an LSTM, a type of RNN well-suited for handling sequential data like time-series weather information, to learn patterns from historical weather data and predict future trends.  LSTMs are particularly effective at capturing long-range dependencies, making them a powerful tool for forecasting.

## üöÄ Features

*   **LSTM-based Forecasting:** Employs a robust LSTM model for accurate weather prediction.
*   **Python 3.12:** Built using the latest Python version for optimal performance and access to modern features.
*   **Kaggle Dataset:** Utilizes a reliable weather dataset from Kaggle (link provided below).
*   **Clear and Modular Code:**  Well-structured code for easy understanding, modification, and extension.
*   **Data Preprocessing and Visualization:** Includes steps for data cleaning, preprocessing, and insightful visualizations.
*   **Train/Test Split:**  Implements a proper train/test split for rigorous model evaluation.
*   **Performance Metrics:**  Calculates relevant metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) to assess prediction accuracy.

## üìÅ Dataset

This project uses the following weather dataset from Kaggle:

*   **Provide a brief description of the dataset here.**  
    *   What features does it contain (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure)?
    *   What is the time resolution (e.g., hourly, daily)?
    *   What is the time period covered by the dataset?
    *   What location(s) does the dataset cover?
    *   Mention any known issues or limitations of the dataset.
*   **Example:**  *This dataset contains hourly weather observations from [City/Region] between [Start Date] and [End Date]. Features include temperature (in Celsius), humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), atmospheric pressure (hPa), and precipitation (mm).*

**Data Preprocessing Steps:**

1.  **Data Loading:**  Loads the dataset using `pandas`.
2.  **Data Cleaning:**
    *   Handles missing values (e.g., using interpolation or removing rows/columns).  *Specify your chosen method.*
    *   Checks for and removes duplicate entries.
    *   Converts data types as necessary (e.g., converting date strings to datetime objects).
3.  **Feature Engineering (Optional):**
    *   Creates new features if necessary (e.g., lag features, rolling averages, cyclical time features). *Describe any feature engineering you perform.*
4.  **Data Normalization/Scaling:**
    *   Scales the data (e.g., using Min-Max scaling or standardization) to improve model performance.  *Specify the scaling method used.*
5.  **Data Splitting:**
    *   Splits the data into training, validation (optional), and testing sets. A common split is 80% training, 10% validation, and 10% testing. *Specify your split ratio.*
6. **Sequence creation**
    * Create sequencies from timeseries dataset to feed the LSTM model.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mikehoai/weather_forcast_LSTM-RNN-.git](https://github.com/mikehoai/weather_forcast_LSTM-RNN-.git) 
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3.12 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
     **`requirements.txt` Example:**
     ```
        pandas
        numpy
        matplotlib
        scikit-learn
        tensorflow # Or torch, depending on your LSTM implementation
        kaggle # If you're using the Kaggle API to download the data
     ```
     *Make sure to list *all* the libraries your project depends on.*

4.  **Download the Dataset:**

    *   **Option 1: Manual Download:** Download the dataset from the Kaggle link provided above and place it in a `data` directory within the project.
    *   **Option 2: Kaggle API (Recommended for Automation):**
        *   Install the Kaggle API: `pip install kaggle`
        *   Authenticate with Kaggle: Follow the instructions on the Kaggle API documentation (usually involves downloading `kaggle.json` to your `~/.kaggle/` directory).
        *   Add a script (e.g., `download_data.py`) to your project to automatically download the dataset using the Kaggle API.  *Include clear instructions on how to use this script in your README.*
        *   Example `download_data.py` snippet (you'll need to adapt this to your specific dataset):

            ```python
            import kaggle

            def download_dataset():
                kaggle.api.dataset_download_files('your-kaggle-username/your-kaggle-dataset-name', path='data/', unzip=True)

            if __name__ == "__main__":
                download_dataset()
            ```

        *   **README Instructions (for Option 2):** *To download the dataset using the Kaggle API, run: `python download_data.py`.  Make sure you have authenticated with Kaggle first.*

## üèÉ Running the Project

1.  **Data Preparation:**
    *   If you haven't already, download the dataset and place it in the `data` directory (or use the Kaggle API download script).
    *   Run any data preprocessing scripts you have (e.g., `python preprocess_data.py`). *You might combine preprocessing and model training into a single script.*

2.  **Model Training:**
    *   Run the main training script (e.g., `python train.py`).  This script should:
        *   Load the preprocessed data.
        *   Define the LSTM model architecture.
        *   Train the model on the training data.
        *   Evaluate the model on the validation set (if used).
        *   Save the trained model (e.g., using `model.save()`).

3.  **Model Evaluation:**
    *   Run the evaluation script (e.g., `python evaluate.py`).  This script should:
        *   Load the trained model.
        *   Load the test data.
        *   Make predictions on the test data.
        *   Calculate and display performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
        *   Optionally, generate visualizations (e.g., plots of predicted vs. actual values).
